# About

This repository contains the software used for Case Study #2 in https://doi.org/10.1145/3731599.3767698, with the objective of making the experiments and results in that case study reproducible.

The software is composed of two parts:

  - The simulator in the `simulator/` directory; and
  - The simulator calibration scripts in the `calibration/` directory.


The experiments in the case study are conducted with the ground-truth data available on [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30132955).
